# Intentional Documentation

# Why don't I write more documentation?

* Documentation is *Hard*
  * Writing and editing
  * Planning and organizing
  * Largely invisible (thankless)
* But most work is hard, so what's special about d11n?

---

# Documentation is a Liability

* Needs maintenance
* Hard to navigate
* Hard to ugess what's useful

Documentation often *feels* useless

---

# Especially at Mozilla

* Where we're learning fast
* and the problem space keeps changing

---

# Especially for Data Scientists

* Racing against irrelevance
* Shorter engagements
* Less repetition

---

# How do we adjust?

* Intentional Documentation 
  ([Counting Stuff](https://counting.substack.com/p/lets-get-intentional-about-documentation),
  [blog.harterrt.com](https://blog.harterrt.com/randy_au_d11n.html))
  * JIT documentation
  * Focus on making it **easy to backfill** documentation
  * Write as little as necessary

---

# Make it easy to backfill

* Focus on tickets, snippets, and proposals
  * Artifacts with a lot of context
  * Already useful day-to-day
  * Takes less willpower
  * (Lizard brains need dopamine hits)
* Push towards async media
  * ([the speeds of communication](https://pulseasync.com/operators/speed-of-communication/?))

---

# What to do next?

* Tickets are working well
* Want to make snippets more useful
  * Silent meetings!
  * Make it easier to review snippets later
  * Make snippets intrinsically useful
* Consider writing more proposals
* Make it easy to exfiltrate context from Slack

---

# Caveats

* Puts pressure on real-time media
  * Fewer docs --> more questions in Slack
  * ... but so does too much documentation
* We're still only accruing documentation
  * This doesn't address how to prune docs
* Doesn't address maintenance (but it does make it easier)
