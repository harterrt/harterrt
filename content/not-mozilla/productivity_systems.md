title: Productivity Systems for Stress Management

Over the years, I've developed a pretty involved productivity system.
It was originally based on [Getting Things Done],
but now it's grown to include the good bits from other systems.
It's involved, but I love it.

I get a lot of comments,
especially on the little black book I keep in my back pocket.
I hear people say they want to get organized so they can be more productive,
but I think that misses the mark.

Getting organized may make you more productive,
but the real benefit is that **getting organized makes you less stressed**.

The intro to "[Getting Things Done]" does a great job of explaining this.
The gist is that filling your consciousness with list of things you have to do **later**
distracts from what you're doing **now**.
Irrelevant stuff keeps popping into your head and causing stress.

Instead of trying to remember all the stuff you need to do,
build a trusted system that will remember for you.
Then all you need to do is set up a few habits to remind you to look at your system.
**Your brain is bad at remembering, but it's good at habits**.

For the past few years, my main goal has been increasing how much I enjoy my work.
**Cutting the stress out of my workday was a huge improvement to my work satisfaction**.
If you're feeling stressed or burnt out,
I highly recommend looking at whether a productivity system would help.
