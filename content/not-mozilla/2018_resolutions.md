## I don't like New Year Resolutions

I don't like most New Year Resolutions.
I think they encourage a bad type of goal setting.
"Resolutions" are usually habits - quit smoking, start exercising - 
but they're rarely paired with plans for enacting those habits.
"Quit smoking" is a fine goal, but you can't execute without more planning.
How are you going to quit?
What can you do *right now* to help yourself quit?

Once I start working out a plan,
I usually realize a year is too long to plan for.
I can usually come up with a decent plan for about a half a year,
but after that it get's too murky.
I commit to reassessing my process midyear.
Often my new year goals need to be revised as well
with my mid-year reassessment.

## But I still do it

New Year Resolutions definitely have their problems,
but every year between Christmas and NYE I find myself reflecting on the last year and planning for next year.

* I like reflecting on what I want to improve over the next year.
  * Plans are useless; Planning is everything
  * Fight prioritization via inertia
  * Find *a way* to shift your life's flow
* I like having a record of what I *thought* was most important a year ago.
  * I usually make progress in these vectors,
    though not always as much as I'd like
  * I like the narrative I get from my goals
    * Take a look at 
      [budgets are sexy](http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/list-of-great-financial-new-years-resolution-ideas/)
      * 17 years of resolutions gives a clear story
    * Looking through my journals I can find a story that's just as clear.
    * So I've decided to start sharing my resolutions here
      hoping it will be easier for me to follow this story

## 2018 Resolutions

I have two major goals for this year.
One for my personal life and one for my professional life.

### Building an Active Lifestyle

First, I want to **develop an exercise routine**
that **doesn't require much willpower**.

A year ago, I bet my **biggest deterrent to working out was convenience**.
So, I focused on building an exercise routine with **minimal startup costs**.
I decided on a bodyweight routine so I wouldn't need to drive to a gym.
I memorized the routine so I wouldn't need to find any notes before starting.
I spent more on simpler equipment that made it easy to start my workout.
Overall, it was a solid success.
I worked out more in the last year than I did in the previous 3
(and I enjoyed it!).

There's still a **lot of room for improvement**, though.
It takes a lot of willpower to keep working out.
When I was busy with work or travel,
exercise was the first thing to get dropped.

It's fine to expend willpower when you're trying to create a new habit,
but **willpower is not a long term solution**.
Eventually, your willpower is going to fail and you'll be back to square one.
To make a habit stick,
**you have to make your lizard-brain *want* what you want**.

And that's the problem.
Doing a bodyweight workout in my living room just isn't fun.
It's boring as hell.
Even worse, **in the moment it feels like a waste of time**.
I could be upstairs in my office solving today's great emergency!
What am I doing down here stretching?

So I'm refocusing my effort.

When I reflected on what did and didn't work in 2017
I noticed that no matter how busy life got
I was able to find time to take a walk in the park with my wife.
Getting out of the house was refreshing.
**It helped keep everything in perspective**.
Even if work was stressful, it was sunny outside and no one else seemed to care.
I could let my mind wander in ways that my focused workouts didn't allow.
Convenience is still important,
but **my exercise also needs to be refreshing**.
