Title: About

## Hi, I'm Ryan

If you care about my technical expertise or credentials, you should refer to my
[resume](http://blog.harterrt.com/resume.pdf) or
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ryan-harter/11/a24/a21).

Email is the best way to contact me.
I try my hardest to get back to everyone, thought there may be a delay.
I'm `harterrt` pretty much everywhere, including Gmail.

I'm not very active on social media, but you can find me on:

* [Github](https://github.com/harterrt)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harterrt),
