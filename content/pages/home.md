Title: Practical Data Science
save_as: index.html

Hi, I'm Ryan.

I use this blog to share what I've learned about practicing data science.

I've spent the last decade as a data scientist and data engineer 
at Shopify, Mozilla, and Google.

It bothers me when data work is needlessly complicated.
I like knocking the varnish off of complicated ideas.


Here's some of my favorite pieces:

* [Pub-true](/pub-true.html)
* [Defining data intuition](/data_intuition.html)
* [Leading with data: cascading metrics](/cascading_metrics.html)
* [Controlled experiments - why bother?](/why_experiment.html)
* [SQL style guide](/sql_style_guide.html)
* [Don't make me code in a text box](/coding_in_textboxes.html)
* [Bad tools are insidious](/bad-tools.html)
* [Writing great documentation (a lit review) ](lit-review.html)

If you want to see _everything_, here's a
