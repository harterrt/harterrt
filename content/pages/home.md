Title: Practical Data Science
save_as: index.html

Hi, I'm Ryan.

I've been doing data work for the last decade,
both as a data scientist and data engineer.
I use this blog to clarify my thinking around how I practice data science.

Here are some of my favorite pieces:

* [Defining data intuition](/data_intuition.html)
* [Pub-true](/pub-true.html)
* [Leading with data: cascading metrics](/cascading_metrics.html)
* [Controlled experiments - why bother?](/why_experiment.html)
* [SQL style guide](/sql_style_guide.html)
* [Don't make me code in a text box](/coding_in_textboxes.html)
* [Bad tools are insidious](/bad-tools.html)
* [Writing great documentation (a lit review) ](lit-review.html)

If you want to see _everything_, here's a 
[chronological index of all my writing](/chrono.html).
