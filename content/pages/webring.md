[Randy Au](https://www.randyau.com/) curates a list of data folks writing on the open web.
I like that, so I've linked to [the webring](https://github.com/randyau/datawebring) here:

</div>

There's a lot of noise out there, especially in data writing.
Folks rehash the same threadbare topics to drive pageviews
(should I learn python or R in 2024?).
Others focus exclusively on hyper-technical topics
far removed from most data folks' day-to-day.
LLM's churn out surface-level chum.

Randy does a good job of writing about practical data problems.
I appreciate that and I hope he attracts similar authors to his webring ðŸ¤˜
