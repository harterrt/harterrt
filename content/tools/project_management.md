I've tried a lot and nothing's really stuck.
The biggest problem for me has been building a good process and sticking with it.
The tools are only secondarily important and there's never going to be a good technological solution for training yourself.

I've had a lot of success with a stack of 3x5 notecards and Google Calendar. 
For bigger projects I use a 8x11 sheet of printer paper to scope the work.
Nothing beats paper's expressiveness.

I can still probably offer some suggestions.
Can you describe the problems you're having?
Here's some I've had for example:

* Too many tasks
    * I can't find the most important thing to work on
    * Looking at my todo list is stressful and counterproductive
* Planning complex projects
    * I can't organize the task dependencies properly
    * Deadlines sneak up on me
* Missing tasks / tasks slip through my system causing surprises

I'm sure I've recommended it before, but consider reading [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B000WH7PKY) for a good overview.
Whenever I feel overloaded, that's the book I open to start debugging the problem.
