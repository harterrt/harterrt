I gave a talk at the Open Data Science Conference a few weeks ago titled: 
[Practical Strategies for Data Storytelling](https://odsc.com/speakers/practical-strategies-for-data-storytelling/).

One problem is that folks don't know what good storytelling _is_.

Most of the time, the issue is that it's not clear what good storytelling _is_.

but don't know how to get started.

Often the problem is that they don't know what good storytelling looks like.
They only know that they need to improve.

Part of the problem is that there's no good 

We had a great turnout for this talk.
Unfortunately some attendees couldn't attend due to seating capacity.
I wish the talk had been recorded.

but they don't know how to get started.

Most of the time, the blocker is that they don't understand 
what good data storytelling _is_.

Most importantly, a lot of folks are confused about what good storytelling _is_.

We're not doing ourselves any favors with the mysticism around storytelling.

The first is that data storytelling is poorly understood.

This talk came because it's necessary.

Standing room only. Lots of interest.

Most vague part of a job ladder.

This talk came out of _practice_.
I've hosted a data storytelling workshop at Shopify for the last two years.

I've hosted a fortnightly workshop on data storytelling at Shopify for the last two years.
