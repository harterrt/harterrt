This is a transcription of a talk I gave at StaffPlus NYC in 2022.

This might sound like I’m going to help you pack more into your day,
but I have to be honest,
the reason I’m writing on this topic is to advocate doing less.
I think we can all get away with doing less and, at the same time, be even more effective and fulfilled in our work.

I had a suspicion that I was wasting half my time at work. But the question was:  How did I figure out which half was the wasted half? I started collecting some data on myself– I started keeping a time log;  I started keeping track of what work I did, how long it took, and how I chose that work. When I reflected on this, I found that, eh, my prioritization wasn’t so great. The processes that I was using to prioritize my work left a lot to be desired.

Bad Defaults
Prioritization by Inertia:
I found that my #1 process for choosing what to work on was inertia. This basically meant that I kept working on what I was already working on. Projects in motion will tend to stay in motion. That’s a problem because there’s a tendency toward this 80/20 split:  I do a little bit of work and tackle 80% of the project. I’m most of the way there, so maybe it’s time for me to move on. Instead, I keep spending time tweaking the remaining 20%. 
I realized I had a lot of room for improvement in this area. Most of my work was prioritized by inertia. 

Prioritization by Decibels:
Working in data, most of my work comes from people asking me questions. Some people are louder than others. I ended up working on projects advocated by folks who were asking more frequently or more loudly. Often, I prioritized whoever asked me last. This has all of the usual biases that you want to avoid– You don’t want to only focus on the folks who are bugging you frequently. You want to focus on the most important work. 
The other problem with prioritizing by decibels is that as staff engineers we’re supposed to be influencing the company (hopefully in a positive direction.) If we're just responding to the questions that people ask us, we’re not really providing that influence. 

Prioritization by Guilt:
Ugh. I said I would do something; it was like a month ago. Somebody caught me in an elevator and I put it on my to do list. Now I’m feeling guilty about not doing it. But, eh, you know, things change. Priorities change and you realize: This isn’t the work I should be doing anymore. Just because it’s on my to-do list from a month ago doesn’t mean it’s currently a priority.

This is what happened before I stopped and thought about how I should be choosing my work.


A Ritual
To help prioritize more effectively, I came up with a ritual. This is a habit that helps me ensure that I'm choosing my work actively. It’s pretty simple; I stayed away from high tech solutions for this. In this ritual, every two weeks I take a break; I step away from work. It takes about half a day to separate myself from the anxiety of the workweek and feeling other people’s pressures. 

Empty your Inbox:
I start by emptying all my inboxes. This looks like taking all the things you could possibly do and putting them in a pile on your desk or floor. Think about it like the first stage of a Marie Kondo purge: You take all your stuff, you throw it on the floor. First you realize, “I have way too much stuff!” Second you ask, “What stuff do I want to keep?” This helps me contextualize. This process really showcases that there's almost always too much to do. You have to draw the line somewhere. If you don’t prioritize your work and just run as hard as you can at it, you’re heading toward burn-out, and that’s a bummer. This first stage of emptying your inbox (and really looking at all of it) helps a lot with workflow management. 

Reflect on the last week
After I empty my inboxes, I take some time and reflect on the past week. I consider: “Is that how I wanted it to go?”; “Was that good?”; “Is there anything I might want to improve?” (There’s always something I want to improve.) There's always some project that didn’t get the attention I wanted it to. There's some work that maybe I shouldn't have done. Priorities change. This helps me step back and make sure that I'm working on the “right” work.
 
Choose your work 
As you would expect, I take some time and I choose my work for the next 2 weeks. Go through, look at the pile on the floor, and pick out maybe a half dozen things (or maybe a dozen things) that I want to get done in the next two weeks. 

This process helped improve my prioritization a lot, but it didn't fix everything. I still found the same biases. I would look back on the last 2 weeks and the same biases would still be there. I started to notice patterns and common pitfalls.  

The Questions
Identifying these patterns and pitfalls led to “The Questions”. I’m proud I came up with this because it sounds cool, but it’s really just a checklist. During that second stage when I reflect on my past 2 weeks, I'd notice these same patterns over and over. So I created a Google doc of questions to prompt myself to stop following these patterns. I encourage you to start your own list, with your own questions to address your own biases. But I’ll bare mine here.

What can you delegate?
The first big pattern that I saw as I was moving up the ladder is that I wasn't delegating, and I should be. So I asked: “What can I delegate?”; “What's in my pile that shouldn't be in my pile and should be elsewhere?”
 
How can you delegate more? 
This isn’t just pushing out more work, it’s also building systems so that I can delegate. Maybe there should be a team working with me on a particular project. Just because I can’t do something right now, maybe there's some knowledge that I need to document that I failed to do earlier. This helps me build that system.  

What should you be working on? 
As you work up the IC ladder, you need to be careful to make sure that you’re packing your week with what should be on your plate. You don't want to waste that other half of your time.

Watch out for:
What “must” you do? (really?)
What feels urgent? Is it?
Who cares? What happens if I drop this?
This set of questions helped me a lot with dealing with prioritization by guilt. Like, “What must you do?” Anything that feels like you “must” is usually a good candidate for “You don’t need to be doing this.” Get rid of it! 
What feels urgent is usually due to prioritization by decibels (I’ve found at least for me). If it feels urgent, then usually I’m picking up on someone else’s excitement or frantickness and putting that into my work.
And finally, “Who cares?” What happens if I just don’t do it? If you can't answer those questions, then, eh, get rid of it. This all helps to limit the of the number of things you need to do in a week so that you can focus deeply on a few things that are most important.

How would you convince your CFO that they can’t afford to lose you?
This has helped me zoom out and figure out, “How am I impacting the business?” Maybe, “How can I do this more? (or better)” ; “How do I show up on this radar?” I purposefully chose the CFO as an example because they tend to be no-nonsense individuals and are good w/ numbers. They could probably tell if I’m pulling my weight or not. Can they really not afford to lose me? 

What do you take home at the end of the week?
I think it’s really important to make sure that you're filling up your own well as you're working. We all want our jobs to be fulfilling and refreshing and get us excited about work. One of the ways that asking this question helps me is to evaluate if I'm better at the end of the week than I was at the beginning of the week. Aiming to be more employable is one metric, or aiming to be more skilled at my job. It’s not great if I'm just churning out analyses one after the other and not really making any progress or improving durable skills. In this situation I try to fit in some solid time for deeper work, which keeps me excited and helps me have impact on the order of years instead of the order of weeks. Ultimately this deep work helps me to progress in my career.

What would change everything?
Stepping back and thinking on the order of years (let’s say 5 years) I like to ask myself, “What would change everything”? What would be the fundamental change for the business that I could start pushing for now? I think of this like the lighthouse, or Where’s my true north? Where can I be working towards to change the business for good?

Strategies for focusing on the most important thing is a simple system (I hope) that I've found to make huge improvements in focusing on really important work. 
Simply put:
-Clear your inboxes
-Reflect on the week
-Choose your work:  take some time to be intentional about the work you do so that you’re having the impact that you can for the company 
-Account for your biases (“The Questions”)
