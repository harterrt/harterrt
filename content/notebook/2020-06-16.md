title: Daily Writing and the "Notebook" Category
slug: notebook/2020-06-16

This past weekend I found 
[drmaciver's post](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html)
on starting a daily writing practice.
I like the idea and I'm going to give it a try.

The content on this blog has never been all that polished,
but I do expect these daily posts will be less consistent 
in quality and topic.
I'm fine with that.
My goal for this blog has always been to (1) become a better writer.
and (2) share context with my peers or anyone interested.
Writing daily supports both of those goals.

I do, however, want folks to be able to opt-out
of my quantity-over-quality writing.
To that end, I've started a new category for my daily writing
called "Notebook" (per drmaciver's suggestion).
If you don't want to see these notebook entries,
I recommend subscribing to the 
[Mozilla RSS feed](/feeds/mozilla.rss.xml)
or reading from the [Mozilla category](/category/mozilla.html).
These are the feeds that get syndicated to 
[Planet Mozilla](https://planet.mozilla.org/).
