title: The Value of a Wild-Ass Guess

I called a plumber to replace my kitchen sink.
When I asked him how much this was going to cost
he said, "I won't know until I can take a look at the job".

I guess that's a reasonable answer. 
He's probably done hundreds of similar jobs
and charged everywhere from $100 to $300 per job.
He needs more information.

But on the other hand, I have *no idea* how much this is going to cost.
I guess somewhere between $100 and $1000?
I would benefit from hearing the plumber's guess.

A few weeks ago, I needed to get a sink fixture replaced.
I called a plumber, he said he had time, and we scheduled an appointment.
I asked him, how much do you think this is going to cost?
He said, oh, I won't know until I can take a look at the job.

I guess that's a reasonable answer. 
He doesn't know how complicated the job will be
and he doesn't want me ancored on a wild-ass guess.

But on the other hand, the plumber does have much more context than I do.
He's probably done hundreds of similar jobs.
I on the other hand have no idea how much this is going to cost.
I guess somewhere between $100 and $1000? Really, idk.

So, I play a game I call, "Orders of Magnitude".
I ask the plumber, how about a rough ballpark? I promise not to hold you to it.
Ehhh, it's hard to say.
So, is it closer to $100, $500, or $1000?

(the world snaps into focus) Oh, not 1000. Like, somewhere between $100 and $300.
The plumber is much more confident now.
They understand my question and my confusion much better.
The structure has helped him make a wild-ass guess.

An order of magnitude guess is *useful* to me.
I have no idea what you charge.
$100 - $300 is a much better guess than my original $100 - $1000.
This type of communication is *generous*.
It gives a lot of context while accepting some risk that you'll be over-interpreted.

This happens all the time in my day-to-day work.
I'll meet with an expert that has much more context than I do,
but it's hard to draw information from them 
because over-focused on their uncertainty.

Usually, their uncertainty doesn't matter to me.
Most of the time I'm trying to get a [pub-true](/pub-true.html) guess
to characterize their expertise.
In the above example, the plumber was arguing between $150 and $250.
That level of uncertainty doesn't change my decicion;
It doesn't matter.

I resort to the order-of-magnitude game frequently.
It's a useful way to shake out some context when the conversation stalls.

* A friend invites me to a party. How many people are you inviting? IDK.
  2? 20? 200? Is it a rave or a dinner party? Oh, like 10. It's a BBQ.
* How many users will see this feature? IDK. 100,000, 1 million, 1 billion?
  Oh, like 10,000. It's pretty niche.

My team is running a series of workshops 
to help Mozilla start doing opportunity sizing.
This pattern keeps arising.

The goal in these workshops is to get folks to take an educated guess
at how big a feature may be *before writing any code*.

Sometimes we have all the necessary data to make a decent estimate.
Other times, we need to make a guess.

Here's a great example, my collegue used in our last training

<!-- TODO: Find the example -->

Here we have some decent data to predict the population, the retention impact,
but we don't have any data for "uptake".


This creates a lot of consternation and hand-wringing.
In reality, it doesn't matter.

Focusing on the uncertainty or subjectiveness of this estimate
causes us to spend too much time on this low-value problem.
When you run into this type of uncertainty,
I encourage you to note it, and barrel through as quickly as possible
with the goal of getting to a guess as quickly as possible.

You can always come back later if your decision is on the borderline.
