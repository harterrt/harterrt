title: Announcing the Cross Sectional Dataset
date: 2016-11-14

I'm happy to announce a new telemetry dataset!

The Cross Sectional dataset makes it easy to describe our users by providing
summary statistics for each client.  Like the Longitudinal table, there's one
row for each client_id in a 1% sample of clients.  However, the Cross Sectional
dataset simplifies your analysis by replacing the longitudinal arrays with
summary statistics.

The dataset is now available in
[STMO](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/1669/source).  You can find
more information in [the
documentation](https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-batch-view/blob/master/docs/choosing_a_dataset.md#cross-sectional).

Take a look and let me know if you have any question or suggestions for new
columns!
