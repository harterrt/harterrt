title: Removing Disqus
slug: disqus
date: 2018-01-02

I'm removing Disqus from this blog.
Disqus allowed readers to post comments on articles.
I added it because it was easy to do,
but I no longer think it's worth keeping.

If you'd like to share your thoughts,
feel free to shoot me an email at `harterrt` on gmail.
I try to respond to all of my email daily.

## Cons

Disqus started showing a red notification symbol at the bottom of every post.
The notification is just a distraction aimed at increasing engagement with the comments.
It's ugly and I don't like the distraction is introduces to my posts.
This is my primary complaint.

Beyond that, there are just small annoyances.
E.g. I don't need another inbox to maintain
and I think the UI is a little ugly.

## Pros

There aren't many.
I've only had one comment on this blog,
and I'm confident I would have gotten that feedback through other channels
had the comment system not been available.
