A year or so ago, I read
[this article](https://hbr.org/2019/09/dont-let-metrics-undermine-your-business)
about how Wells Fargo ended up in such a mess.
If you don't remember,
Wells Fargo was opening accounts in their clients' name without their consent
and ended up paying a few hundred million dollars in fines.

Long story short, a big part of the problem
was that WF set a few metrics to guide the company,
set strong incentives to optimize those metrics,
and blindly let the machine get to work.
The company did a great job of optimizing the metrics
but lost sight of the strategy the metrics were meant to represent.

This tendency to confuse metrics for a strategy is called **Surrogation**
(I keep forgetting this word, which is half of why I'm posting this here).
When I'm talking to other data scientists
I usually hear this put like, 
"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"
([Goodhardt's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)).
