Randy Au has a great post on documentation for data scientists here:
[Let's get intentional about documentation](https://counting.substack.com/p/lets-get-intentional-about-documentation).
Take a look, it's worth a read.

I've been able to find some decent guides for writing documentation
but they're usually targeted at engineers.
That's a shame. 
Data scientists have significantly different 
constraints and needs when writing documentation.

I really like Randy's suggestion to **focus on keeping good work records
instead of focusing on writing complete documentation**.
Writing "good documentation" is a huge task
and it's hard to predict *what* documentation will be useful.
Instead of guessing, **make it easy to backfill documentation later**.

Keeping good records might look like 
tracking your work in tickets or publishing weekly snippets.
I talked about how these records can be personally useful in
[this post](writing_inside_organizations.html).
As an added bonus, good records make it much easier to backfill documentation
once you identify what documentation is missing.

I mentioned earlier that documenting data science work
is significantly different than documenting engineering work.
One of they key differences is that 
data scientists tend to do more once-and-done work than engineers.
**Data science is a race against irrelevance**.
The world is changing around us 
and we need to deliver insights before our findings go stale.

It's impossible and inefficient to try to document all of this one-off work.
Only a small portion of the resulting documentation would ever be used.
Even worse, the useful documentation will be hidden in a sea of useless noise.

Instead, data scientists should focus on keeping good work records,
contextualizing their analyses,
and preparing themselves to backfill documentation later.


Finally, this quote is a gem:

> ... [Documentation] is a MASSIVE, continent-sized, topic.
> Sadly, I’m not informed enough to tackle the entire continent 
> and I’ve only got a few thousand words of to use in a post.
> To cope, I’m gonna employ the time-honored move
> of harrowed data scientists everywhere — 
> reduce scope by fiat and attempt to dazzle the audience 
> with “directional” findings until I can form a strong case later on.
