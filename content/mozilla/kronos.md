title: Review: The consultant out of time
slug: out-of-time

I was reading Tom Critchlow's
[consultant out of time](https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/26/kairos/).
He writes about finding success as an independent consultant,
but it really really sounds like he's writing about Data Science sometimes.

Take this quote for example (emphasis and brackets mine):

> A real example from my own work - the client asks for 
[some specific piece of work],
but when you offer a three-week completion time they push back.
Asking whatâ€™s driving the urgency, 
you discover that there is a quarterly executive meeting
next week and that they need two slides on [something much simpler]. 

> Ok! Now we know where the real deadline is and **what the real ask is** - 
not only can we deliver that more easily in the timeframe 
but we also have a much better understanding of 
what this need is and who the stakeholders are.

Sound familiar?

I hear this from data scientists all. the. time. 
We spend a lot of time working with stakeholders 
to figure out what their *real* need is.
I usually call this *undigesting* the request

It's nobody's fault. 
Usually my stakeholder is trying to be helpful by 
simplifying their request into a straightforward analysis.
It's just that the translation from "business need" to "straightforward analysis"
is really difficult to do well.
Now that I think about it, 
this skill is most of what separates a Senior DS from a Junior DS.
