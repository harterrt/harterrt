title: Planning Data Science is hard: EDA

Data science is weird.
It looks a lot like software engineering
but in practice the two are very different.
I've been trying to pin down where these differences come from.

Michael Kaminsky hit on a couple of key points
in his series on Agile Management for Data Science
on [Locally Optimistic](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/).
In [Part II](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/agile-analytics-p2/index.html#exploratory-data-analysis)
Michael notes that Exploratory Data Analyses (EDA) are difficult to plan for:
"The nature of exploratory data analysis means
that the objectives of the analysis may change as you do the work." - Bingo!

I've run into this problem a bunch of times when trying to set OKRs for major analyses.
It's nearly impossible to scope a project
if I haven't already done some exploratory analysis.
**I didn't have this problem when I was doing engineering work**.
If I had a rough idea of what pieces I needed to stitch together,
I could at least come up with an order-of-magnitude estimate
of how long a project would take to complete.
Not so with Data Science:
I have a hard time differentiating between
analyses that are going to take two **weeks** and 
analyses that are going to take two **quarters**.

That's all. No deep insight.
Just a +1 and a pointer to the folks who got there first.
