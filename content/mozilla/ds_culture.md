All analyses are flawed.
That doesn't mean there's nothing to learn from a flawed analysis.
But there is a tendancy for peer reviews to devolve into pissing matches.
I believe the culture of review is a critical part of a functioning data science team.

Enabling learning while still allowing for progress.
Deciding on whether to share an analysis based on whether it will
help the organization function better
not on whether it is perfectly sound.
