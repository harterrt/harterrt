title: Bad Tools are Insidious

# Bad Tools are Insidious

This is my first job making tools for others to use.
In the past, I've always been a data scientist -
a consumer of these tools.
I'm learning a lot.

This past quarter, I learned that bad tools are often hard to spot even when they're damaging productivity.
I sum this up by saying that **bad tools are insidious**.
This may be [obvious to you](https://sivers.org/obvious) but I'm excited by the insight.

## Bad tools are hard to spot

This past quarter, I spent some time working directly with analysts building ETL jobs.
I found some big usability gaps with our tools,
and I was surprised I wasn't hearing about these problems from our analysts.

I looked back to previous jobs where I was on the other side of this equation.
I remember being totally engrossed in a problem and excited to finding a solution.
All I wanted were tools good enough to get the job done.
I didn't care to reflect on how I could make the process smoother.
I wanted to explore and interate.

When I dug into analyses this quarter, I had a different perspective.
I was working with the intention of improving our tools,
the analysis was secondary.
It was much easier to find workflow improvements this way.

In the [Design of Everyday Things](todo) 
Donald notes that users tend to blame themselves when they have difficulty with tools.
I think this probably has some bearing here as well. 

## Bad tools hurt

If our users aren't complaining, is it really a problem that needs to get fixed?
I think so.
We all understand that bad tools hurt our productivity.
However, I think we tend to underestimate the value of good tools when we do our mental accounting.

Say I'm working on a new ETL job that takes ~5 minutes to test by hand
but ~1 minute to test programatically.
By default, I'd value implementing good tests at 4 minutes per test run.

This is a huge underestimate!
Testing by hand introduces a context shift, another chance to get distracted,
and another chance to fall out of flow.
I'll bet a 5 minute distraction can easily end up costing me 20 minutes of productivity on a good day.

Your tools should be a joy to use.
The better they work, the easier it is to stay in flow, be creative, and stay excited.


# In Summary

Don't expect your users to tell you how to improve your tools.
You're probably going to need to [eat your own dogfood](todo).









# Draft & Appendix
Your users don't always recognize the flaws in your tools,
but these flaws can still create big problems.

I just finished writing my OKRs for the quarter, and I feel like I need some additional explaination.
I have two headline projects, building documentation for our data pipeline and consulting.

I split off a big chunk of my time for the next quarter to work directly with our analysts and data scientists.
I'm super excited to get started, but I want to clarify my goals.

There are a lot of good reasons to not do this type of work.
It doesn't scale well - data engineers are meant to build tools, not analyses.

Our goal is to

# Bad Tools are Insidious

At Mozilla, I'm working on enabling a data driven culture.
I build tools to make data useful.
I carved out a big chunk of my time for the next quarter to spend working directly with our clients building analyses.
In this post I want to explain why.

It's hard to know what needs to be fixed.

# Bad Tools are Insidious

Your users will not call out problems with your tools.
You need to dogfood yourself and find problems.

# Bad tools are hard to spot
This past quarter, I spent some time working directly with analysts building ETL jobs.
I found some big usability gaps with our tools,
and I was surprised I wasn't hearing about these problems from our users.
I'm realizing that people don't always recognize when tools are making their lives difficult.

This makes it makes it really hard to know what to work on next.

Bad tools chafe like bad boots.
Once you notice it it's unbearable, but it can take a while to notice.
I fell into this trap recently.


## The Symptoms

### Kills Creativity
I've been caught in this trap plenty of times before.
When I started as an analyst, all of my tools were bad.
My clients wanted work done exclusively in excel.
The work was repetetive and error prone.

Repetetive work kills my creativity.
I get into this mode where I focus on following the steps,
and I can't step back and see the big picture.


# We don't notice bad tools
## Some users discard and move on
## Done is good enough - bounce between Most important task
## Marginal cost is never there
## Blame ourselves / just the way it is
# They hurt our work
## Kills Flow
## Taxes Willpower
Most of the time the marginal cost of fixing the tool is much greater than the marginal value.
If I stop and fix the tool it will cost 10 hours of work,
but if I just work around it it will only take 3 hours.
The incentives push you to muddle through, but that doesn't scale well.
