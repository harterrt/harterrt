title: Bad Tools are Insidious

This is my first job making data tools that other people use.
In the past, I've always been a data scientist -
a consumer of these tools.
I'm learning a lot.

Last quarter, I learned that bad tools are often hard to spot even when they're damaging productivity.
I sum this up by saying that **bad tools are insidious**.
This may be [obvious to you](https://sivers.org/obvious) but I'm excited by the insight.

## Bad tools are hard to spot

I spent some time working directly with analysts building ETL jobs.
I found some big usability gaps with our tools
and I was surprised I wasn't hearing about these problems from our analysts.

I looked back to previous jobs where I was on the other side of this equation.
I remember being totally engrossed in a problem and excited to finding a solution.
All I wanted were tools good enough to get the job done.
I didn't care to reflect on how I could make the process smoother.
I wanted to explore and interate.

When I dug into analyses this quarter, I had a different perspective.
I was working with the intention of improving our tools
and the analysis was secondary.
It was much easier to find workflow improvements this way.

In the [Design of Everyday Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) 
Donald notes that users tend to blame themselves when they have difficulty with tools.
That's probably part of the issue here as well.

## Bad tools hurt

If our users aren't complaining, is it really a problem that needs to get fixed?
I think so.
We all understand that bad tools hurt our productivity.
However, I think we tend to underestimate the value of good tools when we do our mental accounting.

Say I'm working on a new ETL job that takes ~5 minutes to test by hand
but ~1 minute to test programatically.
By default, I'd value implementing good tests at 4 minutes per test run.

This is a huge underestimate!
Testing by hand introduces a context shift, another chance to get distracted,
and another chance to fall out of flow.
I'll bet a 5 minute distraction can easily end up costing me 20 minutes of productivity on a good day.

Your tools should be a joy to use.
The better they work, the easier it is to stay in flow, be creative, and stay excited.

# In Summary

Don't expect your users to tell you how to improve your tools.
