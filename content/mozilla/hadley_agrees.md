I came across 
[You can't do data science in a GUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpbtcsGE0OA)
by Hadley Wickham a little while ago.
He hits on a lot of the same problems I mentioned in
[Don't make me code in your text box](https://blog.harterrt.com/coding_in_textboxes.html).
Take a look if you have some time.
In the first 15m he covers the arguement against coding in a GUI.
After that he plugs for R and the tidyverse.
