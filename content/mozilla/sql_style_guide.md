I'm happy to announce, we now have a 
[SQL style guide](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/sql_style.html).
Check it out!

If you have any suggestions,
feel free to file a PR or issue in
[the docs repository](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-data-docs/blob/master/concepts/sql_style.md).

Many thanks to all who participated in the 
[St. Mocli conversation](https://github.com/mozilla/stmocli/issues/9)
and @mreid for the review!
