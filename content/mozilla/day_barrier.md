I was talking with Mark Reid
about some of the problems with [Coding in a GUI](coding_in_textboxes.html).
He nailed part of the problem with soundbite too good not to share:

This is a persistent problem with tools that make you code in a GUI.
These tools are great for working on bite-sized problems,
but the workflow becomes painful
when the problem needs to be broken into pieces and attacked separately.

Part of the problem is that I can't test the code.
That means I need to understand how each change will affect the entire code base.
It's impossible to compartmentalize.

GUI's also make it difficult to split a problem across people.
If I can't track changes easily
it's impossible to tell whether my changes conflict with a peer's changes.

So look out, [bad tools are insidious](bad-tools.html)!
If you find yourself abandoning an analysis because it's hard to refactor,
consider choosing a different toolchain next time.
Especially if it's because there's no easy way to move your code out of a GUI!
