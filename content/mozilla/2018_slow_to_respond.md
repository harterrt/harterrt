title: Slow to respond through 2018
slug: 2018_slow_to_respond
date: 2018-12-10

I'm working on an urgent and high priority request for the next few weeks.
To make sure I can finish this work in 2018
I'm **limiting my meetings and communications** for the remainder of the year.

Slack is good for getting my immediate attention,
but if your request takes more than a one word response
it's likely to get lost in the shuffle.
If you need me to take some action 
[filing a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?assigned_to=rharter%40mozilla.com&bug_file_loc=http%3A%2F%2F&bug_ignored=0&bug_severity=normal&bug_status=NEW&cf_fx_iteration=---&cf_fx_points=---&component=General&contenttypemethod=list&contenttypeselection=text%2Fplain&flag_type-4=X&flag_type-607=X&flag_type-800=X&flag_type-803=X&form_name=enter_bug&maketemplate=Remember%20values%20as%20bookmarkable%20template&op_sys=Mac%20OS%20X&priority=--&product=Data%20Science&rep_platform=x86_64&target_milestone=---&version=unspecified)
is your best bet.
If you don't want to file a bug, email is fine.
Keep in mind that my response time will be very slow during this time.

If you need immediate help, try the following:

*  If your question is about a search analysis or new search telemetry,
   please contact bmiroglio AT mozilla.com
*  If your question is about search data, see the documentation here.
   If that doesn't help, contact wlach AT mozilla.com
*  For general data science questions contact rweiss AT mozilla.com
*  For general telemetry questions,
   ask #fx-metrics on Slack or #datapipeline on IRC

Otherwise, I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
Thanks for your understanding.
