My team adopted OKRs earlier this year, and it's been a learning process.

I have a feeling we're not doing it right,
but I haven't been able to put my finger on why until recently.
The most obvious symptom is that we tend to have a lot of OKRs.
For the last few quarters,
our team has had 4-5 OKRs and I've had about the same number of personal OKRs.
With so many OKRs it's difficult to prioritize my daily work between goals

The most obvious sy
One of the traps 

One of the problems we're running into is that we still require
setting quarterly 'Deliverables' in addition to OKRs.
Everyone talks about OKRs, but the system makes you input deliverables.
* These things are very different, and it causes some stress.
  Deliverables are related to bonuses, and you shouldn't be hitting 70%.
* Even worse, deliverables feel like unneccessary busy work.
  We get the overhead of both systems, with none of the clarity! Hooray!

I've been digging into 4DX(TODO) over the last couple of weeks,
and I've picked up some interesting insight.

OKRs should not scope your work for the next quarter.
OKRs are similar to the Wildly Important Goal.
Separate from the "Whirlwind" of your daily activity.
The marginal work that will have the biggest impact on your goals.
Only a portion of what you do every quarter.
