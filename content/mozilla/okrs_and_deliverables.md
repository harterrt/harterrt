Acronyms on acronyms.

My team adopted OKRs earlier this year, and it's been a learning process.
I just recently started digging through 4DX,
and, surprisingly, it's making OKRs make a lot more sense.
This post outlines some ideas I've picked up through my reading.

## Too many goals

For the last few quarters, my team has had 4-5 Objectives.
That's a little high, but it's within the recommended limits for OKRs.
The problem is that I have a hard time prioritizing between the topline goals
when I'm planning my work for a day, or for a week.
Do I work on experimentation or search? /shrugman

When we set OKRs,
it feels like we're scoping out what work we can get done in the next quarter.
That leads to an OKR process that goes something like this:

* List out all the project work we could do,
  order by importance,
  and **pack the quarter/year** until it's full.
* Group our project work into **3-5 major themes**.
* **Explain why** we're doing each class of projects (Objectives)
* **Dream up metrics** to describe success and set Key Results

It's a useful excersize.
We can clearly communicate to other teams what we're working on
and why certain projects were deprioritized.
In fact, I like this process a lot and I think we should keep it.
But, I don't think it harnesses the true value of OKRs. 

Specifically, I think it 
**encourages us to set goals for projects that don't need them**.
For example, The last two quarters,
I've set OKRs for consulting and answering questions for client teams.
In no world am I going to start ignoring client teams because it doesn't match my OKRs.
It's an obvious (to me) priority.
The OKR isn't a goal anymore, it's a placeholder for the time commitment.

## The Fix

Instead, consider this process:
**Assume nothing changes in the next quarter**.
We keep executing on our day-to-day tasks just like we have in the past.
We answer questions, fix bugs, improve our tools.
All of it.

Now, what **one thing could we change** to have the biggest marginal impact on the business?
That's our new objective.

This is totally different from before.
We're **not scoping out work** for the next quarter.
We're identifying the **one improvement we're going to protect**
from the whirlwind of our daily work.

## The Benefits

Our team has a lot of projects going on at the same time.
It's easy to feel disconnected from a teammate if you don't work on the same projects,
especially with a remote team like ours.
Instead, you'll **feel more connected** 
if you and your team are all **working on the same big-scary goal**
Even if you're only contributing an hour or two that week.

Emergencies flare up every now and then,
but I hate it when I spend a week putting out a fire
and realize I didn't make any progress on my OKRs.
I call these *Zero Weeks*.
In my experience, every week is crazy in it's own unique way.
But, even in the midst of a crazy week,
it's **usually easy to sneak in an hour of work for a long term priority**.
On the other hand,
It's not easy to sneak in an hour of work for four long term priorities.
**Focused objectives cut back on *Zero Weeks* **

More momentum.
Executing on one project means it gets over the finish line and doesn't lose gas.

## But what about all the other work?

One of the problems we're running into is that we still require
setting quarterly 'Deliverables' in addition to OKRs.
Everyone talks about OKRs, but the system makes you input deliverables.
* These things are very different, and it causes some stress.
  Deliverables are related to bonuses, and you shouldn't be hitting 70%.
* Even worse, deliverables feel like unneccessary busy work.
  We get the overhead of both systems, with none of the clarity! Hooray!

I've been digging into 4DX(TODO) over the last couple of weeks,
and I've picked up some interesting insight.

OKRs should not scope your work for the next quarter.
OKRs are similar to the Wildly Important Goal.
Separate from the "Whirlwind" of your daily activity.
The marginal work that will have the biggest impact on your goals.
Only a portion of what you do every quarter.
