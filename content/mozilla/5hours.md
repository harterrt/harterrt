title: Five Hours a Day is Plenty
slug: 5hours

I average about 5 hours of work per day. I have for years.


It seems to be working for me too.
I've been promoted a few times 
and my managers are happy with my performance.

I'm here to convince you that five hours-per-day is plenty of work.

I've been open about this practice at Mozilla,
but I've never written it down before.
For obvious reasons - who want's to tell their manager they work few hours.

But, I keep having this conversation with peers that I'm mentoring.

Occasionally, I get asked by my peers how I schedule my work.
They notice that I tend to keep weird hours.
I often respond to emails late in the day and early in the morning.

When I explain that I don't think a 9-5 schedule is acheivable,
there's a palpable releif.

I really don't think a 9-5 schedule is acheivable.
