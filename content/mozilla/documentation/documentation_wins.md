title: Documentation Wins
date: 2017-06-16
status: draft


* Documentation is now at least as good as what we had before.
    * Wiki docs are migrated
    * Conceptual documentation migrated from other repos
* We're getting feedback
    * Users can register complaints! Hoorah!
        * Used to be: rabble rabble in IRC, maybe someone fixes it, forget about it
        * Now: File a bug, it gets prioritized, someone gets the time to fix it properly
    * Have a Documentation Component
    * Have open bugs for major missing documentation
* Documentation is centralized and approachable
    * Centralized
        * Before: github, wiki, blog posts, that one guy's document
        * Now: All in a gitbook, searchable from browser
    * Approachable
        * Before:
            * Neophyte: I wan't to know about telemetry!
            * Someone: Here's a hodge-podge of documents, without clear goals,
                covering different parts of the data pipeline, and all the code used
                to generate the data.
        * Now:
            * Here's some recommended reading that slowly introduces you to our system
                Stop after you read this much.
            * (Not really, still missing some docs. Complain here!)
* Real version control means you can:
    * Share praise
    * Find an expert
    * Gague freshness
    * View the history (why couldn't I do this before?)
    * GET REVIEW!
        * means more people can contribute - Less harm in being wrong and trying
    * Write long form content
        * You're editing in your favorite text editor - not in a vanilla text box
        * Writing over multiple days is much easier when done locally
