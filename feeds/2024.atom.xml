&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last two years, I've hosted a biweekly data storytelling workshop
for my peers at Shopify.
This talk is an attempt to share some of my experience more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Maybe include the slide and intro blurb here instead --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by the turnout we had -
a lot of data folks want to improve their storytelling.
A lot of these folks also don't know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not surprising.
Storytelling is the vaguest part of most data science job ladders.
Many of the folks trying to improve their storytelling
don't know what data storytelling &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.
No wonder it's so hard to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big problem I see 
is that folks don't know how to start their storytelling &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt;.
They know they want to improve - 
but at a very tactical level, they don't know what exercises to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to address both of these in my talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot more to say, but I don't have time right now.
The internet is littered with promises of another essay coming soon.
I won't make any promises here.
Fingers crossed - I hope to expand on this talk soon.&lt;/p&gt;

## Appendix





When folks get stuck trying to improve their data storytelling, 
there's usually two problems:

1. They don't know what data storytelling _is_,
   though they usually have some idea about why it's important
2. They don't know how to jump start their storytelling practice. 
   They don't have a useful feedback loop.






It's not hard to imagine. 
There's not a ton of writing on _how_ to do good data storytelling.
"Storytelling with data" is a good start, but over indexes on making graphics.
Graphs are only a small part of telling a good story.



----

and doesn't do much to explain what storytelling _is_. 

This can be very frustrating.

More often than not, 
when someone is told they need to improve their storytelling
they don't really know what good storytelling _is_.

Usually, when someone is struggling with storytelling
it's because they don't know what good storytelling _is_.

Folks usually get stuck for one of a few reasons:

* They don't understand what data storytelling _is_
* They don't feel comfortable being opinionated
* They don't understand their audience

One problem is that folks don't know what good storytelling _is_.

Most of the time, the issue is that it's not clear what good storytelling _is_.

but don't know how to get started.

Often the problem is that they don't know what good storytelling looks like.
They only know that they need to improve.

Part of the problem is that there's no good 

We had a great turnout for this talk.
Unfortunately some attendees couldn't attend due to seating capacity.
I wish the talk had been recorded.

I've found that lots of data folks want to improve their storytelling,
but they don't know how to get started.

Most of the time, the blocker is that they don't understand 
what good data storytelling _is_.

Most importantly, a lot of folks are confused about what good storytelling _is_.

We're not doing ourselves any favors with the mysticism around storytelling.

The first is that data storytelling is poorly understood.

This talk came because it's necessary.

Standing room only. Lots of interest.

Most vague part of a job ladder.

This talk came out of _practice_.
I've hosted a data storytelling workshop at Shopify for the last two years.

I've hosted a fortnightly workshop on data storytelling at Shopify for the last two years.

my job description became more ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stepped back to take a look at my work, and I was surprised to find that my
biggest wins hadn’t come from technical feats or shipped code. Instead, I
realized that most of my success could be attributed to more subtle decisions
that were never shared with my stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was hard to sell to my management chain and largely went
unrecognized. Fortunately, a few close colleagues noticed that projects went
more smoothly when I was onboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get recognition for fighting fires, but it’s hard to get
recognized for &lt;em&gt;preventing&lt;/em&gt; fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article covers some strategies for making these Staff+ superpowers
understandable to the company, both so we can get rewarded for this work and
demystify some of what reaching Staff+ level looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is invisible work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, I’ll define invisible work to make sure we’re all on the same page.
Invisible work is work that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Critical to your success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes skill to do well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is never shown to stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My background is in data science. I can confidently say that almost all of my
work is invisible. Good analysis is a process of 
developing hypotheses &lt;em&gt;and then discarding them&lt;/em&gt;.
My client only sees my final product, polished up and ready
for the showroom. I never show the pile of cracked and discarded hypotheses
hidden in my workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good thing! I dig into a problem, understand it deeply, then simplify
my understanding for my peers. If I’m doing my job well, I’m making it look
easy. This can cause problems when going for promotion though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invisible work is by no means limited to data work. I’ve saved the company
months of effort by taking an afternoon to sit on my couch and carefully write
a project spec – only to decide the project isn’t worth pursuing after all.
This is a triumph even if it doesn’t lead to an exciting launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 
&lt;em&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/em&gt; , Fred Brooks tells us to plan on 
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#The_pilot_system"&gt;throwing one away&lt;/a&gt;.
This sacrificial prototype is important (but invisible) work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is no exception. There are at least two drafts that will
(thankfully) never see the light of day. I’ve also had countless conversations
with mentors and peers to help develop the idea of invisible work. This
pre-work is critical and underappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why’s that a problem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one of my previous gigs, I got a performance review that effectively said,
‘We want to see you demonstrate more complexity in your work.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface that might sound fine, but this thinking is backward and too
common in the industry. Really, what we should want are 
&lt;em&gt;simple solutions to complex problems&lt;/em&gt;.
The complexity of our work is a cost to bear, not something to maximize!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen this type of pro-complexity thinking cause all sorts of dysfunctions.
I’ve seen folks slip machine learning into places it doesn’t belong to get a
flashy launch. Occasionally folks build long-winded and boring reports
documenting every possible bit of complexity to prove how hard the problem was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these cases, we’re incentivizing complexity. In the end, you’re
going to get more of what you incentivize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telling a good story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep down, most people feel like my job is cranking out technical code. I’m
guilty of this myself. When I have my hands on a keyboard it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like work.
It’s reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality though, a lot of the work that’s critical to my success no longer
matches that description. This became even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; true as I moved up the IC
ladder. Now stuff like making sure I’m solving the &lt;em&gt;right problem&lt;/em&gt; is at the
core
of my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to convince myself and others that the core of my work changed. I found
the best way to do that was by &lt;strong&gt;creating a clear and memorable story&lt;/strong&gt; about
what I do and why it’s hard. Once I understood this well, I was able to make
better decisions about my work and convince others that it was important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here was to &lt;strong&gt;focus on what was actually hard about my work&lt;/strong&gt;.
Sometimes it was a technical piece, but more often, it wasn’t. Was the hardest
part of your last project writing the code? Or was it framing the problem well,
getting buy-in, and getting a budget?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a story, &lt;strong&gt;focus on what outcomes you created&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t focus on
the code you pumped out or the report you wrote. Focus on how your work changed
the company. Maybe you found a team that was angry and stressed - but then you
jumped in, gave direction, and left that team feeling happy and relieved.
That’s awesome! You should do more of that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three practical tips to help you build this story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fight recency bias with snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a brag doc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice your story until it’s smooth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fight recency bias (with snippets)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snippets are a habit I picked up at Google. The key here is to make a habit of
summarizing your work at regular intervals. I do this every other week but some
prefer to do it weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snippets are a way to collect data on yourself. Try to be specific. Include
links to artifacts if you can. Try to document where you’re spending your time
and energy, not just the stuff that’s obviously work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that once a problem is well-framed, there’s usually an obvious solution.
The hard part is getting to a well-framed problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I look back on my work I only see the solution I came up with,
not the work that went into framing the problem well. Snippets make it easy to
remember where the hard and important work actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep a brag document&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is common advice – but that’s because it’s useful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep a list of my professional successes in a Google Doc. Every time I’m
excited about a project going well, I try to make a quick note of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nice ego boost, but it’s useful too. This excitement fades quickly
and it becomes hard to remember what I was excited about even a month later.
When I look at my brag doc it serves as an index to my weekly snippets, showing
me where to look for important work. Plus it’s a nice dopamine hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work the story until it’s smooth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you try telling your story, it’s going to be clunky. The only
way to get past this is practice. Work your story over until it’s smooth. In
the ideal case, you want this story to be able to spread by word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like practicing my story in my 1:1s. Usually someone asks me what I’ve been
up to. This is a great chance to share what you think was &lt;em&gt;actually difficult&lt;/em&gt;
about your work this week. Replacing the usual small talk with commentary on my
invisible work has sparked some great conversations with my coworkers. Pretty
often there’s a flash of recognition where they realize that – yeah, that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;
really hard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to share your story with your manager too. Your manager is
eventually going to be in a room with their peers arguing for why you need a
promotion. If you’ve armed your manager with a great story about why your work
is hard, they’re going to be grateful to you for making them look smart.&lt;/p&gt;
