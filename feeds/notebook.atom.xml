I review a list of prompts that help me choose important work.
One of the oldest prompts on my list is:
"&lt;strong&gt;What will you take home at the end of the week?&lt;/strong&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this a while ago in 
&lt;a href="https://blog.harterrt.com/new_tools.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;
about evaluating new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of my &lt;a href="https://esimoney.com/two-huge-reasons-why-your-career-matters/"&gt;career as an asset&lt;/a&gt;,
so if I get to do work that builds transferable skills,
I count that as part of my compensation.
On the other hand,
if I'm writing glue scripts to deal with idiosyncrasies in an internal tool,
I'm missing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the type of work I do today
affects how valuable my career is in the long term.
I take this into account when choosing my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is really strong in this dimension.
We're an open company
which means I get to work in the open,
work with open-source tools,
and blog about my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is a great example of taking something home.
The obvious benefit is that I'll be able to reference my public writing forever.
Maybe a bigger benefit is the career capital I build by improving my writing 
and broadening my network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, blogging was only a small part of how I worked in the open.
I got to write a bunch of code and prose on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/harterrt"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.
I reviewed PR's in the open and commented on public bugs.
I'll be able to point to that work for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the manager, this can be a great incentive for you reports.
I know working in the open played a part in my decision to work at Mozilla.
As I noted in &lt;a href="https://blog.harterrt.com/new_tools.html"&gt;New Tools&lt;/a&gt;,
you can help your reports take something home by using open source tools internally.
These things are like instant raises that don't cost the company a dime.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notebook"></category></entry><entry><title>Keeping a Journal</title><link href="https://blog.harterrt.com/notebook/2020-07-08.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-08T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-07-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan T.

&lt;p&gt;This is great advice.
I've kept a journal for almost a decade now
and it's definitely improved my career
especially as I've become more senior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments on HN appear to be missing the point though.
Most of the commentors note that keeping a lab book
helps them keep a record of what work they've done
and how they made decisions.
It's a tool to reference later.
That's not at all how I use my journal.
I almost never review old journal entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I use &lt;strong&gt;journaling to help me work through unresolved problems&lt;/strong&gt;.
For example, I might take an hour in the morning to pull apart
why a difficult meeting went off the rails
or what my next actions should be on a difficult project.
Journaling is a &lt;strong&gt;tool for self-reflection and self-improvement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journaling is also great for helping me &lt;strong&gt;break free from inertia&lt;/strong&gt;.
Being effective mostly boils down to working on the right project.
If I don't take a break to step back and review my progress,
I often end up working on a project because I was working on it last week.
This prioritization-by-inertia is a crummy way to choose work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a cultural inertia too.
For example, it's really easy to get distracted
by a fire-drill that's getting a lot of attention.
It can be really &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to dedicate a couple of days to the urgent work.
However - I find the urgent work isn't always that important.
Journaling can help me identify unimportant work as unimportant.
You can drive a lot of value by being the cool head in the middle of a fire-drill.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notebook"></category></entry><entry><title>Post hoc ergo propter hoc</title><link href="https://blog.harterrt.com/notebook/2020-06-17.md.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-17T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan T.

&lt;p&gt;Economists have a handy phrase to describe a fairly common fallacy:
"Post hoc ergo propter hoc" meaning "After, therefore because".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has an example of how this might look in the wild:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists have a handy phrase to describe a fairly common fallacy:
"Post hoc ergo propter hoc" meaning "After, therefore because".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has an example of how this might look in the wild:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tenant moves into an apartment
and the building's furnace develops a fault.
The manager blames the tenant's arrival for the malfunction.
One event merely followed the other, in the absence of causality.
(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tech this might manifest as part of a feature launch.
Say we launch a feature on a Monday
and on Tuesday our retention goes way up.
We're tempted to think that our feature launch 
&lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; the increase in retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be a fine assumption if our metrics are generally constant 
but more often than not this is just another case
of &lt;strong&gt;correlation not meaning causation&lt;/strong&gt;.
Just because these events happened together (albeit with a lag)
doesn't mean that they were causally linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With how volatile the world has been this year, this is even more relevant.
Our metrics are moving up and down
for reasons totally unrelated to our individual actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, I'd deal with this type of risk by &lt;strong&gt;running a controlled experiment&lt;/strong&gt;.
We randomly split some users into two equal groups
and give them different product experiences. 
If the users behave differently,
then we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that the difference is caused
by the difference in the product experience
and not some arbitrary outside force.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notebook"></category></entry><entry><title>Daily Writing and the "Notebook" Category</title><link href="https://blog.harterrt.com/notebook/2020-06-16.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-16T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan T.

on starting a daily writing practice.
I like the idea and I'm going to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content on this blog has never been all that polished,
but I do expect these daily posts will be less consistent 
in quality and topic.
I'm fine with that.
My goal for this blog has always been to (1) become a better writer.
and (2) share context with my peers or anyone interested.
Writing daily supports both of those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, however, want folks to be able to opt-out
of my quantity-over-quality writing.
To that end, I've started a new category for my daily writing
called "Notebook" (per drmaciver's suggestion).
If you don't want to see these notebook entries,
I recommend subscribing to the 
&lt;a href="/feeds/mozilla.rss.xml"&gt;Mozilla RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;
or reading from the &lt;a href="/category/mozilla.html"&gt;Mozilla category&lt;/a&gt;.
These are the feeds that get syndicated to 
&lt;a href="https://planet.mozilla.org/"&gt;Planet Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notebook"></category></entry></feed>
