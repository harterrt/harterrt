&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html"&gt;drmaciver's post&lt;/a&gt;
on starting a daily writing practice.
I like the idea and I'm going to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content on this blog has never been all that polished,
but I do expect these daily posts will be less consistent 
in quality and topic.
I'm fine with that.
My goal for this blog has always been to (1) become a better writer.
and (2) share context with my peers or anyone interested.
Writing daily supports both of those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, however, want folks to be able to opt-out
of my quantity-over-quality writing.
To that end, I've started a new category for my daily writing
called "Notebook" (per drmaciver's suggestion).
If you don't want to see these notebook entries,
I recommend subscribing to the 
&lt;a href="/feeds/mozilla.rss.xml"&gt;Mozilla RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;
or reading from the &lt;a href="/category/mozilla.html"&gt;Mozilla category&lt;/a&gt;.
These are the feeds that get syndicated to 
&lt;a href="https://planet.mozilla.org/"&gt;Planet Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notebook"></category></entry></feed>
