&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html"&gt;drmaclver's post&lt;/a&gt;
on starting a daily writing practice.
I like the idea and I'm going to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content on this blog has never been all that polished,
but I do expect these daily posts will be less consistent quality-wise.
I'm fine with that.
My goal for this blog has always been to (1) become a better writer.
and (2) share context with my peers or anyone interested.
Writing daily supports both of those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do however want folks to be able to opt-out
of my quantity-over-quality writing.
To that end, I've started a new category for my daily writing
called "Notebook", per drmaclver's suggestion.
If you don't want to see these notebook entries,
I recommend subscribing to the "Mozilla" RSS feed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is successful,
there are going to be a lot more posts coming through this blog.
I also expect that the topics and quality my posts
are going to be less consistent.
To avoid spamming people, I started a new category for my daily writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to write more.
To that end, I'm trying to find a way to write every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the posts on this blog were finished on the same day they were started&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notebook"></category></entry></feed>
