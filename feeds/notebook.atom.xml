&lt;p&gt;Economists have a handy phrase to describe a fairly common fallacy:
"Post hoc ergo propter hoc" meaning "After, therefore because".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has an example of how this might look in the wild:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tenant moves into an apartment
and the building's furnace develops a fault.

&lt;p&gt;Economists have a handy phrase to describe a fairly common fallacy:
"Post hoc ergo propter hoc" meaning "After, therefore because".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has an example of how this might look in the wild:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tenant moves into an apartment
and the building's furnace develops a fault.
The manager blames the tenant's arrival for the malfunction.
One event merely followed the other, in the absence of causality.
(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tech this might manifest as part of a feature launch.
Say we launch a feature on a Monday
and on Tuesday our retention goes way up.
We're tempted to think that our feature launch 
&lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; the increase in retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be a fine assumption if our metrics are generally constant 
but more often than not this is just another case
of &lt;strong&gt;correlation not meaning causation&lt;/strong&gt;.
Just because these events happened together (albeit with a lag)
doesn't mean that they were causally linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With how volatile the world has been this year, this is even more relevant.
Our metrics are moving up and down
for reasons totally unrelated to our individual actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, I'd deal with this type of risk by &lt;strong&gt;running a controlled experiment&lt;/strong&gt;.
We randomly split some users into two equal groups
and give them different product experiences. 
If the users behave differently,
then we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that the difference is caused
by the difference in the product experience
and not some arbitrary outside force.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notebook"></category></entry><entry><title>Daily Writing and the "Notebook" Category</title><link href="https://blog.harterrt.com/notebook/2020-06-16.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-16T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan T.

&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html"&gt;drmaciver's post&lt;/a&gt;
on starting a daily writing practice.
I like the idea and I'm going to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content on this blog has never been all that polished,
but I do expect these daily posts will be less consistent 
in quality and topic.
I'm fine with that.
My goal for this blog has always been to (1) become a better writer.
and (2) share context with my peers or anyone interested.
Writing daily supports both of those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, however, want folks to be able to opt-out
of my quantity-over-quality writing.
To that end, I've started a new category for my daily writing
called "Notebook" (per drmaciver's suggestion).
If you don't want to see these notebook entries,
I recommend subscribing to the 
&lt;a href="/feeds/mozilla.rss.xml"&gt;Mozilla RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;
or reading from the &lt;a href="/category/mozilla.html"&gt;Mozilla category&lt;/a&gt;.
These are the feeds that get syndicated to 
&lt;a href="https://planet.mozilla.org/"&gt;Planet Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notebook"></category></entry></feed>
