  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>This is my first job making data tools that other people use.
In the past, I've always been a data scientist -
a consumer of these tools.
I'm learning a lot.</p>
<p>Last quarter, I learned that bad tools are often hard to spot even when they're damaging productivity.
I sum this up by saying that <strong>bad tools are insidious</strong>.
This may be <a href="https://sivers.org/obvious">obvious to you</a> but I'm excited by the insight.</p>
<h2 id="bad-tools-are-hard-to-spot">Bad tools are hard to spot</h2>
<p>I spent some time working directly with analysts building ETL jobs.
I found some big usability gaps with our tools
and I was surprised I wasn't hearing about these problems from our analysts.</p>
<p>I looked back to previous jobs where I was on the other side of this equation.
I remember being totally engrossed in a problem and excited to finding a solution.
All I wanted were tools good enough to get the job done.
I didn't care to reflect on how I could make the process smoother.
I wanted to explore and interate.</p>
<p>When I dug into analyses this quarter, I had a different perspective.
I was working with the intention of improving our tools
and the analysis was secondary.
It was much easier to find workflow improvements this way.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things">Design of Everyday Things</a> 
Donald notes that users tend to blame themselves when they have difficulty with tools.
That's probably part of the issue here as well.</p>
<h2 id="bad-tools-hurt">Bad tools hurt</h2>
<p>If our users aren't complaining, is it really a problem that needs to get fixed?
I think so.
We all understand that bad tools hurt our productivity.
However, I think we tend to underestimate the value of good tools when we do our mental accounting.</p>
<p>Say I'm working on a new ETL job that takes ~5 minutes to test by hand
but ~1 minute to test programatically.
By default, I'd value implementing good tests at 4 minutes per test run.</p>
<p>This is a huge underestimate!
Testing by hand introduces a context shift, another chance to get distracted,
and another chance to fall out of flow.
I'll bet a 5 minute distraction can easily end up costing me 20 minutes of productivity on a good day.</p>
<p>Your tools should be a joy to use.
The better they work, the easier it is to stay in flow, be creative, and stay excited.</p>
<h1 id="in-summary">In Summary</h1>
<p>Don't expect your users to tell you how to improve your tools.
You're probably going to need to
