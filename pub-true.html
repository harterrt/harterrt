    <p>I'm ramping up on a project to understand how Firefox retains users.
Right now I'm trying to build some context quickly.
For example, what's our monthly retention? How about our annual retention?
There's a bunch of interesting and nuanced measurement questions
that we'll eventually have to answer,
but for now I'm just interested in getting some quick back-of-the-envelope numbers.</p>
<p>There's a conflict here though.
I get a lot of value from having loose and squishy estimates.
But, if I share these numbers the results often get passed around
via word-of-mouth and the numbers start to look more solid than they are
(a second cousin to <a href="https://xkcd.com/978/">citogenesis</a>).</p>
<p>It's easier to express uncertainty in person than it is in writing.
In person, I can shrug my shoulders and rock my hand back and forth
signaling, "Kinda, sorta, maybe...".
In writing, caveats take up a lot of space and often confuse muddy my point.</p>
<p>Instead, <strong>I've started describing these soft-and-squishy numbers
as "pub true"</strong> or "true enough".
Basically, the idea is that they'd hold up in a bar conversation
but they're not meant to be used for much else.
It get's you into the ballpark
but you probably shouldn't bet the business on them.</p>
<p>I'm happy with the results so far.
Folks seem to register that we're having a casual discussion of the numbers.
It feels like "pub true" status gets passed along with the results.
It's a nice and succinct description.</p>
<h3>An Order of Magnitude</h3>
<p>In particular, I use I use "pub true" numbers
to unblock some early stage conversations.
When I'm starting a new project
<strong>conversations are often stilted by trying to be too accurate</strong>.
Folks are reticent to share numbers if they don't have exact numbers.</p>
<p>For example, I might ask someone "How many releases do we do a year?".
In a formal environment, they might think for a bit and come up with "I don't know"
even though I know they have more context than I do.</p>
<p>In their head, my peer's thinking,
"We usually release monthly but we had some bug-fix releases last year,
so it could be as many as 15."
The problem is, I know next to nothing so any new context is useful.</p>
<p>I find that re-framing the conversation to something casual gets better results.
If I throw out some ridiculous numbers I can usually get a reasonable estimate back.
For example, I might say "So like 100 releases or 50?".
Pretty often folks come back with a quick and informal, 
"Oh, no - nothing like that. Maybe, like 12. Definitely no more than 20."</p>
<p>Great. Pub true. Hand wavy, quick and effective.</p>
