<p>I called a plumber to replace my kitchen sink.
When I asked him how much this was going to cost
he said, "I won't know until I can take a look at the job".</p>
<p>I guess that's a reasonable answer. 
He's probably done hundreds of similar jobs
and charged everywhere from $100 to $300 per job.
He needs more information.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I have <em>no idea</em> how much this is going to cost.
I guess somewhere between $100 and $1000?
Even though the plumber isn't confident in his guess,
I would benefit from hearing it.</p>

<!---
A few weeks ago, I needed to get a sink fixture replaced.
I called a plumber, he said he had time, and we scheduled an appointment.
I asked him, how much do you think this is going to cost?
He said, oh, I won't know until I can take a look at the job.

I guess that's a reasonable answer. 
He doesn't know how complicated the job will be
and he doesn't want me ancored on a wild-ass guess.

But on the other hand, the plumber does have much more context than I do.
He's probably done hundreds of similar jobs.
I on the other hand have no idea how much this is going to cost.
I guess somewhere between $100 and $1000? Really, idk.
--->

<p>So, I play a game I call, "Orders of Magnitude".
I ask the plumber, how about a rough ballpark? I promise not to hold you to it.
Ehhh, it's hard to say.
So, is it closer to $100, $500, or $1000?</p>
<p>(the world snaps into focus) Oh, not 1000. Like, somewhere between $100 and $300.
The plumber is much more confident now.
They understand my question and my confusion much better.
The structure has helped him make a wild-ass guess.</p>
<p>An order of magnitude guess is <em>useful</em> to me.
I have no idea what you charge.
$100 - $300 is a much better guess than my original $100 - $1000.
This type of communication is <em>generous</em>.
It gives a lot of context while accepting some risk that you'll be over-interpreted.</p>
<hr />
<p>This happens all the time in my day-to-day work.
I'll meet with an expert that has much more context than I do,
but it's hard to draw information from them 
because over-focused on their uncertainty.</p>
<p>Usually, their uncertainty doesn't matter to me.
Most of the time I'm trying to get a <a href="/pub-true.html">pub-true</a> guess
to characterize their expertise.
In the above example, the plumber was arguing between $150 and $250.
That level of uncertainty doesn't change my decicion;
It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I resort to the order-of-magnitude game frequently.
It's a useful way to shake out some context when the conversation stalls.</p>
<ul>
<li>A friend invites me to a party. How many people are you inviting? IDK.
  2? 20? 200? Is it a rave or a dinner party? Oh, like 10. It's a BBQ.</li>
<li>How many users will see this feature? IDK. 100,000, 1 million, 1 billion?
  Oh, like 10,000. It's pretty niche.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>My team is running a series of workshops 
to help Mozilla start doing opportunity sizing.
This pattern keeps arising.</p>
<p>The goal in these workshops is to get folks to take an educated guess
at how big a feature may be <em>before writing any code</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have all the necessary data to make a decent estimate.
Other times, we need to make a guess.</p>
<p>Here's a great example, my collegue used in our last training</p>
<!-- TODO: Find the example -->

<p>Here we have some decent data to predict the population, the retention impact,
but we don't have any data for "uptake".</p>
<p>This creates a lot of consternation and hand-wringing.
In reality, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Focusing on the uncertainty or subjectiveness of this estimate
causes us to spend too much time on this low-value problem.
When you run into this type of uncertainty,
I encourage you to note it, and barrel through as quickly as possible
with the goal of getting to a guess as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You can always come back later if your decision is on the borderline.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Folks have an easier time identifying answers that are "wrong" 
  than picking the "right" answer.</li>
<li>Maybe a better name is a "communicative guess". Be generous with your context.</li>
</ul>
