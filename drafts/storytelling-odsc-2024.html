    <h1><a href="https://blog.harterrt.com/drafts/storytelling-odsc-2024.html">Talk: Practical Strategies for Data Storytelling</a></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I gave a talk at the Open Data Science Conference a few weeks ago titled: 
<a href="https://odsc.com/speakers/practical-strategies-for-data-storytelling/">Practical Strategies for Data Storytelling</a>.
I have more to say on the subject, but in the meantime you can see my 
<a href="/static/odsc2024/index.html#p1">slides and speaker notes here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>For the last two years, I've hosted a biweekly data storytelling workshop
for my peers at Shopify.
This talk is an attempt to share some of my experience more broadly.</p>
<!-- Maybe include the slide and intro blurb here instead -->

<p>I was surprised by the turnout we had -
a lot of data folks want to improve their storytelling.
Unfortunately, a lot of these folks also don't know where to start.</p>
<p>That's not surprising.
Storytelling is the vaguest part of most data science job ladders.
Many of the folks trying to improve their storytelling
don't know what data storytelling <em>is</em>.
No wonder it's so hard to improve.</p>
<p>The other big problem I see 
is that folks don't know how to start their storytelling practice.
They know they want to improve - 
but at a very tactical level they don't know what exercises to do.</p>
<p>I try to address both of these in my talk.</p>
<p>I have a lot more to say, but I don't have time right now.
The internet is littered with blogs promising another essay coming soon.
I won't make any promises here,
but fingers crossed - I hope to expand on this talk soon.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Appendix</h2>
<p>When folks get stuck trying to improve their data storytelling, 
there's usually two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>They don't know what data storytelling <em>is</em>,
   though they usually have some idea about why it's important</li>
<li>They don't know how to jump start their storytelling practice. 
   They don't have a useful feedback loop.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not hard to imagine. 
There's not a ton of writing on <em>how</em> to do good data storytelling.
"Storytelling with data" is a good start, but over indexes on making graphics.
Graphs are only a small part of telling a good story.</p>
<hr />
<p>and doesn't do much to explain what storytelling <em>is</em>. </p>
<p>This can be very frustrating.</p>
<p>More often than not, 
when someone is told they need to improve their storytelling
they don't really know what good storytelling <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Usually, when someone is struggling with storytelling
it's because they don't know what good storytelling <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Folks usually get stuck for one of a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don't understand what data storytelling <em>is</em></li>
<li>They don't feel comfortable being opinionated</li>
<li>They don't understand their audience</li>
</ul>
<p>One problem is that folks don't know what good storytelling <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the issue is that it's not clear what good storytelling <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>but don't know how to get started.</p>
<p>Often the problem is that they don't know what good storytelling looks like.
They only know that they need to improve.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that there's no good </p>
<p>We had a great turnout for this talk.
Unfortunately some attendees couldn't attend due to seating capacity.
I wish the talk had been recorded.</p>
<p>I've found that lots of data folks want to improve their storytelling,
but they don't know how to get started.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the blocker is that they don't understand 
what good data storytelling <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a lot of folks are confused about what good storytelling <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>We're not doing ourselves any favors with the mysticism around storytelling.</p>
<p>The first is that data storytelling is poorly understood.</p>
<hr />
<p>This talk came because it's necessary.</p>
<p>Standing room only. Lots of interest.</p>
<p>Most vague part of a job ladder.</p>
<p>This talk came out of <em>practice</em>.
I've hosted a data storytelling workshop at Shopify for the last two years.</p>
<p>I've hosted a fortnightly workshop on data storytelling at Shopify for the last two years.</p>
