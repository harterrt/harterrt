    <h1><a href="https://blog.harterrt.com/drafts/coffee_bs.html">Data Intuition Case Study: Coffee Consumption</a></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I found this whitepaper on the front page of Hacker News a few weeks ago:
<a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/2/e038902">Coffee consumption and risk of prostate cancer</a>.</p>
<p>My data intuition started raising alarms immediately.
So much so that I expect 
most data professionals immediately write this study off as bullshit.
To verify, I sent the paper to some of my peers and got similar feedback.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity to work through the paper 
and demonstrate where my intuition triggers.
Think of this as a case study on <a href="/data_intuition.html">data intuition</a>.
I hope to write a few of these case studies.
Hopefully folks will be able to use these case studies to 
develop their intuition and spot common data problems.</p>
<p>The paper is pretty easy to read. 
It's only 8 pages long with a lot of graphics.
I encourage you to give it a skim and form your own opinions.
Keep in mind, there's nothing <em>wrong</em> with this paper.
I'm not calling for a retraction.
It's just at risk of being misinterpreted.</p>
<p>We're going to be discussing health-related topics,
so I find it necessary to note that this is not medical advice.
I am not a doctor, which means I am not <em>your</em> doctor.
This is an article on data <em>intuition</em>,
which means I didn't even read this paper all that carefully.
Caveat lector.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let's dig in!</p>
<h2>Correlation != Causation</h2>
<p>This is the first alarm that went off in my head,
so it's our first topic.</p>
<p>The authors are careful to never state this directly,
but the paper begs to be read as,
"Drinking coffee decreases the risk of prostate cancer".
I expect most people who read this paper 
will at least consider whether they should have another cup of coffee
to improve their health.</p>
<p>"Drinking coffee decreases the risk of prostate cancer"
is a <em>causal</em> statement.
We're saying that drinking coffee <em>causes</em> some change in our health.
However, this paper does not establish causation.
It is a correlational study, and we all know,
"Correlation does not imply causation"</p>
<p>I've harped on this before in <a href="/why_experiment.html">this piece</a> on experimentation.
I want to give this point extra attention,
because lot's of people seem to know catch phrase
but don't apply it in practice.
To establish causation, we'd need something like a controlled experiment.</p>
<p>The logical jump from correlation to causation <em>feels</em> natural.
We <em>want</em> to extend the pattern.
I encourage you to resist this urge. 
More often than not, this instinct is faulty.
A careful skepticism will serve you well when working with data.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there certainly <em>could</em> be a causal relationship here.
We just haven't looked hard enough to know.</p>
<p>This isn't a free pass to throw away the research.
Gordon Shotwell has a great quote to this point
in his post on Vitamin D and COVID-19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thereâ€™s a particular type of person on the internet 
who sees a graph like this 
and reaches deep into their data science boot-camp memories 
to exclaim 'Correlation doesn't imply causation!'"</p>
<p>-- Gordon Shotwell, <a href="https://shotwell.ca/posts/supplment_vitamin_d/">Vitamin D and Covid: We don't need to wait for more data</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, there's also a relevant XKCD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Correlation doesn't imply causation, 
but it does waggle its eyebrows [...] while mouthing "look over there" 
<a href="https://xkcd.com/552/">https://xkcd.com/552/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data intuition is a balance of championing data while remaining a skeptic.
Let's review the particulars of the paper
and decide whether we believe the results.</p>
