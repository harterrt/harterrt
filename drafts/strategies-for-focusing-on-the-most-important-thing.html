    <p>This post is derived from a talk I gave at StaffPlus NYC in 2022.</p>

<p>This talk is titled, "Strategies for focusing on the Most Important Thing".</p>
<p>It might sound like I’m going to help you pack more into your day,
but really, I want to convince you to do less.</p>
<p>I think most of us can get away with doing less 
while being even more effecive at work.</p>
<p>Early in my career I had a suspicion I was wasting a lot of time at work.
I started collecting some data on myself – I started with a time log.
I kept track of what work I did, how long it took, and how I chose that work.</p>
<p>The data made it pretty clear that there were significant biases in how I choose my work.</p>
<h2 id="bad-defaults">Bad Defaults</h2>
<h3 id="prioritization-by-inertia">Prioritization by Inertia</h3>
<p>I found that most of the time I choose my work based off of inertia.
This basically meant that I kept working on what I was already working on.
Projects in motion will tend to stay in motion.</p>
<p>This is a problem because 
I very often get 80% of the value from the first 20% of my work.
Most of the time that means it's time for me to move on.
Continuing to grind on a project is wasted effort.</p>
<h3 id="prioritization-by-decibels">Prioritization by Decibels</h3>
<p>Since I work in data, most of my work comes from people asking me questions.</p>
<p>Some people are louder than others. 
I ended up working on projects that had advocates who ask more frequently or more loudly.
Often, I prioritized whichever stakeholder had prodded me last.</p>
<p>Sure this bias away from more important work, 
but responding to decibels also reinforces that <em>this</em> 
is how stakeholders should get their work prioritized.</p>
<p>The other problem with prioritizing by decibels 
is that as staff engineers we’re supposed to be influencing the company.
If we're just responding to the questions that people ask us,
we’re not really providing that influence. </p>
<h3 id="prioritization-by-guilt">Prioritization by Guilt</h3>
<p>Ugh. I said I would do something; it was like a month ago.
Somebody caught me in an elevator and I put it on my TODO list.
Now I’m feeling guilty about not doing it.</p>
<p>But things change! 
Priorities change and you realize 
<em>this isn’t the work I should be doing anymore</em>.
Just because it’s on my TODO list doesn’t mean it’s a priority.</p>
<h2 id="a-ritual">A Ritual</h2>
<p>I came up with a weekly ritual to help me fight these anti-patterns.</p>
<p>Every two weeks I step away from my day-to-day work and do the following:</p>
<h3 id="empty-your-inbox">Empty your Inbox</h3>
<p>I start by emptying all my inboxes.
For me, this looks like taking all the things I could possibly do
and writing them down on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Think about it like the first stage of a Marie Kondo purge:
You take all your stuff, you throw it on the floor.
First you realize, “I have way too much stuff!”.
Second you ask, “What stuff do I want to keep?”.</p>
<p><em>Every time</em> I do this, I realize there's always too much to do.
I have to draw the line somewhere.
Otherwise, I'll just run as hard as I can until I burn out.</p>
<p>It's better <em>I</em> choose where to draw the line 
instead of letting my exhaustion decide.</p>
<h3 id="reflect-on-the-last-week">Reflect on the last week</h3>
<p>After I empty my inboxes, I take some time and reflect on the past week.
I ask myself: “Is that how I wanted it to go?”; “Was that good?”; 
“Is there anything I might want to improve?” </p>
<p>There’s always something I want to improve.
There's always some project that didn’t get the attention I wanted it to.
There's some work that maybe I shouldn't have done.
Priorities change.
This helps me step back and make sure that I'm working on the “right” work.</p>
<h3 id="choose-your-work">Choose your work</h3>
<p>As you would expect, I take some time and I choose my work for the next 2 weeks.
I go through, look at the pile on the floor, 
and pick out maybe a dozen tasks that I want to get done in the next two weeks.</p>
<h3 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it simple</h3>
<p>That's it. It’s pretty simple.
The important part is breaking out of my rhythm.
I purposely stayed away from anything technology heavy.</p>
<p>This process helped a lot, but it didn't fix everything.
I still found the same biases.
During my reflections I would see the same biases over and over again.</p>
<h2 id="the-questions">The Questions</h2>
<p>Identifying these patterns and pitfalls led to “The Questions”.
I’m proud of these because it sounds cool, but it’s really just a checklist.</p>
<p>I created a Google doc of questions to prompt myself while choosing my work.
I encourage you to start your own list, 
with your own questions to address your own biases. 
But I’ll share mine here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What can you delegate?</strong>
  Delegating is a muscle I needed to build as I became more senior.
  The other side of this question is asking, 
  "What is on my list that nobody else can do?"
  I usually bump these tasks a little higher up my TODO list.</li>
<li><strong>How can you delegate more?</strong>
  This isn’t just pushing out more work, it’s also building systems so that I can delegate.
  Maybe there should be a team working with me on a particular project.
  Just because I can’t do something right now,
  maybe there's some knowledge that I need to document that I failed to do earlier.
  This helps me build that system.  </li>
<li><strong>What should you be working on?</strong>
  As you work up the IC ladder, you need to be careful to make sure that you’re packing your week with what should be on your plate. You don't want to waste that other half of your time.</li>
<li><strong>What “must” you do?</strong>
  Anything that feels like you “must” is usually a good candidate for 
  “You don’t need to be doing this.” Get rid of it! </li>
<li><strong>What feels urgent? Is it?</strong>
  What feels urgent is usually due to prioritization by decibels (I’ve found at least for me). If it feels urgent, then usually I’m picking up on someone else’s excitement or frantickness and putting that into my work.</li>
<li><strong>Who cares? What happens if I drop this?</strong>
  If you can't answer those questions, then, eh, get rid of it.</li>
<li><strong>How would you convince your CFO that they can’t afford to lose you?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What do you take home at the end of the week?</strong>
  (<a href="/notebook/2020-07-10.html">related post here</a>)
  It's important to fill your well as you work. 
  This question makes sure I see long term progress in my career,
  which I find rewarding.
  Ultimately this deep work helps me to progress in my career.</li>
<li><strong>What would change everything?</strong>
  I try to step back and think on the order of years instead of week.
  Often, the work that matters today might not matter in a month.
  Thinking about the long term makes it easier to pick the useful work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Strategies for focusing on the most important thing is a simple system (I hope)
that I've found to make huge improvements in focusing on really important work. 
Simply put:
-Clear your inboxes
-Reflect on the week
-Choose your work:  take some time to be intentional about the work you do so that you’re having the impact that you can for the company 
-Account for your biases (“The Questions”)</p>
